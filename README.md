# Question_Generation_from_Text

This project focuses on automatically generating questions from a given input text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and pre-trained language models.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to input a paragraph or sentence and receive a set of meaningful questions generated from that input. This has applications in:

- Educational tools and tutoring systems 
- Reading comprehension and language learning platforms 
- Automatic quiz/test generation systems 

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Transformers (Hugging Face )
- BERT / T5 / GPT-based models
- NLTK or spaCy (for preprocessing)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
